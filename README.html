<h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Howgoodismyfood aims to make sense of the nutritional information found on all food packaging.
  </p>
  <p>
  After seeing a Channel4 TV program about the food industries behavior towards the labeling of their products
  we decided to make a simple application that displayed the truth about what's in our food, using the FSA (Food Standards Agency) traffic light system.

<h1>How?</h1>
<p>
  The FSA traffic light labelling (http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/foodlabels/trafficlights/) provides a clear indiction of the nutritional value of a product. It is designed to be unambiguous and easy to read by the consumer
</p>
<p>
  In Howgoodismyfood you simply enter the product barcode you want to check. 
  If the product is available you'll be displayed the traffic light labeling of the product.
  If the product is not available you'll be prompted with a simple form to complete, and then the labeling can be calculated.
  <b>Easy!</b>
</p>
<p>
  You can use it from you main computer or from your mobile, for free and without membership!
</p>  
<h1>Help us</h1>
<p>
  We'll work soon on the API side in pinging some barcode databases. If you want to participate to the project, it's open source now so be free to fork it.
